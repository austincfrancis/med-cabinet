            <h2>The Model</h2>
            <p>Natural Language Processing is implemented in this application 
               to take a user's description input and process it to be compared 
               and visualized with the description of each strain currently in 
               our data. A Nearest Neighbors clustering algorithm is able to 
               then return the most closely related strains using the processed 
               input.</p>
